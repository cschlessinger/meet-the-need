Meet the Need connects junior developers looking for experience and people with personal projects who need access to developers to help them realize their dreams.

This was a group effort undertaken as our final project at Dev Bootcamp. Our team of four students spent six days diving deep into Rails and PostgreSQL. This project enhanced our understanding of ActiveRecord associations, schema design, good git workflow, Agile methodology, and vertical slicing.

Still, there's plenty of work to be done. We'd like to integrate payments to do more for our users, and maybe work with Basecamp's API, too. More of the functionality could be converted to Ajax to make for a smoother UX. We'd like users to be able to browse by tags and generally build out more robust searching. And of course, there's always room for cleaning up code and refactoring. Still, for most of us, this was the first full-fledged app we'd built, and it culminated a mere 18 weeks of learning to code. We can't wait to find out what else lies ahead.

(Please switch the branch to "development" to see our work!)
